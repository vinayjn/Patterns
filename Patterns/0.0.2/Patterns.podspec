    Patterns is an easy to use, pure-Swift library for drawing patterns so that you don't have to ship iOS apps with blank backgrounds.

    To ease the usage with interface builders, all of the patterns are made @IBDesignables, set the properties directly from the interface builder, set some constraints to the view and you are ready to go.
